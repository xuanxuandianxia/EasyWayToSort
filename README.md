An Easy way to Sort Numbers（bucket sort）
just use ```./run.sh``` then you can get 100K random number and 100K sorted number based on those random numbers.
It may take a while because I haven't optimiz this program , but it's truely fast enough for sort positive integer.  be ware this program is using ```int```as data type so when you can't put a number bigger than 2^16 -1 or less than -2^16
