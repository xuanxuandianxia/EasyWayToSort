An Easy way to Sort Numbers（bucket sort）
just use ``` ./run.sh``` and follow the notice ,then you will get 100K random number and 100K sorted number based on those random numbers.
It may take a while because I haven't optimiz this program and build a large ***TEXT*** file is time wasted, but this kind of algorithm truely fast enough for sort ***positive integer***.  be ware this program is using ``` int```as the data type so you can't put a biggest value bigger than 2^16 -1 or less than -2^16
